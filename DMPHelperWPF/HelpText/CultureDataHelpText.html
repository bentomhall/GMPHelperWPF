    <h1>races.json Format</h1>
    <p>This config file contains information about the races and cultures of the setting. Each unique combination of race and nation should be represented; if not, the program will crash when it tries to generate a missing combination.</p>

    <h2>Element Format and necessary keys</h2>
    This file (like all the rest), is a list of mappings. The keys must be spelled exactly as written (including capitalization), but the order doesn't matter.
