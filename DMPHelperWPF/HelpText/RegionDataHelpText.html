    <h1>regionData.json Format</h1>
    <p>This config file contains information about the large geographical regions of the setting. This is particularly used to generate adventure sites.</p>

    <h2>Element Format and necessary keys</h2>
    This file (like all the rest), is a list of mappings. The keys must be spelled exactly as written (including capitalization), but the order doesn't matter.
