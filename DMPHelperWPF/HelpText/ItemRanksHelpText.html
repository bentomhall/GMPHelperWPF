    <h1>itemRanks.json Format</h1>
    <p>This config file contains information about the availability of each item when generating settlements. The tech levels range from 0 (primitive) to 4 (full availability)</p>

    <h2>Element Format and necessary keys</h2>
    This file (like all the rest), is a list of mappings. The keys must be spelled exactly as written (including capitalization), but the order doesn't matter.
