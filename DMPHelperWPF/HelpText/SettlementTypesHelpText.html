    <h1>settlementTypes.json Format</h1>
    <p>This config file contains information about the different types of minor settlements (not major cities) that are present in the setting.</p>

    <h2>JSON format</h2>
    <p>Data types are set out in italics like <em>string</em>. The relevant data types are:</p>
    <table>

    <h2>Element Format and necessary keys</h2>
    This file (like all the rest), is a list of mappings. The keys must be spelled exactly as written (including capitalization), but the order doesn't matter.
