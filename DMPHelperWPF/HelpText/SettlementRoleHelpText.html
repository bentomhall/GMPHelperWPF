    <h1>nations.json Format</h1>
    <p>This config file contains information about the various nations and their racial makeup.</p>

    <h2>Element Format and necessary keys</h2>
    This file (like all the rest), is a list of mappings. The keys must be spelled exactly as written (including capitalization), but the order doesn't matter.
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Key</td>
                <td>Data Type</td>
                <td>Comments</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Name</td>
                <td><em>string</em></td>
                <td>A unique identifier used to connect to other files.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Specialities</td>
                <td>list of {"Name": <em>string</em>, "Modifier": <em>int</em>}</td>
                <td>
                    The Name values must also be found in the Category property of the Item config file.
                    The Modifiers are how much the tech level for that category changes. For example, a wizard's complex might have a much higher Arcane tech level than it does a Divine tech level.
