# GMPHelperWPF
A port from UWP to WPF of DMPrepHelper. This is the one that will be maintained

Designed to help overworked GMs and world-builders generate content that matches their setting. This product contains several modules:

* It can generate lists of NPCs using customizable lists of names, races, cultures, and personalities.
* It can generate settlements ranging from isolated hermit huts to towns with important NPCs already penciled in, with demographic lists, and with lists of goods and services available based on the technology level of the area.
* It can generate lists of adventure site ideas, including suggested level, major monster type, terrain type, size (both scale and number of mapped areas), and whether there's a boss-type monster present.

All of the data for these generators is freely customizable within the program and (mostly) system independent. The only assumptions that it makes are the existence of tiers of play. The data files come with full documentation.

Generated items can be exported to structured plain text files for ease of inclusion with other campaign notes.

## Legal and Version Notes
